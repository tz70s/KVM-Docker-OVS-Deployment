# FOG ENVIRONMENT TESTING 

### Step1

* Objective
```BASH
Achieve Latency Simulation
Use Kubernetes to distribute traffic/load to different node 
Use Kubernetes API to dynamically change policy based on latency change
```

* Testing Scenario
```BASH
Distributed web server
Records number of requests distribute to diiferent containers/pods/nodes
Kubernetes policy changes based on latency change
```

### Step2

* Objective
```BASH
Add OpenvSwitch/OVN to kuberentes cluster in overlay mode
GRE/Vxlan tunneling
```

### Step3

* Objective
```BASH
Set SDN Controller and migrate with kubernetes master node
```

### Step4

* Objective
```BASH
Add routing policy
```
